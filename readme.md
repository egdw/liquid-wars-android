# Liquid Wars for Android

The source is from [xenris] (https://github.com/xenris/liquid-wars-android), but the original code was too old, so I made some modest fixes to make it work on Android9.0 and above. It also adds support for Chinese.

Liquid Wars is a complete rewrite and redesign of the original
game "Liquid War" (http://www.ufoot.org/liquidwar/), but has
been designed for the Android operating system.

On Linux machines (and probably most other Unix based machines) the
build.sh, install.sh and run.sh shell scripts should build, install
and run on a debug device, provided the Android SDK, NDK and adb are
set up correctly.
